## 🤖 About Model
### <b> Why rcnn_resnet50 ?? </b>
* ResNet's ability to stack many layers enables it to learn complex features at different levels of abstraction, crucial for recognizing objects in images.
* The skip connections in ResNet prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which can hinder training in very deep networks. 
ResNet is often used as the "backbone" network within popular object detection architectures like Faster R-CNN, providing the foundation for feature extraction.
